abstract = {We propose a new optimal trajectory generation technique on SE(3) which avoids known obstacles. We leverage techniques from differential geometry and Lie algebra to formulate a cost functional which is intrinsic to the geometric structure of this space and makes physical sense. We propose an approximation technique to generate trajectories on the subgroup SO(3) and use Semidefinite Programming (SDP) to approximate an NP-Hard problem with one which is tractable to compute. From this trajectory on the subgroup, the trajectory generation on the other dimensions of the group becomes a Quadratic Program (QP). For obstacle avoidance, we use a computational geometric technique to decompose the environment into overlapping convex regions to confine the trajectory. We show how this motion planning technique can be used to generate feasible trajectories for a space robot in SE(3) and describe controllers that enable the execution of the generated trajectory. We compare our method to other geometric techniques for calculating trajectories on SO(3) and SE(3), but in an obstacle-free environment.},

abstract = {Astrobee is a new class of free-flying robots designed to operate inside the International Space Station and perform surveying, monitoring, sensing and scientific tasks. Astrobee's capabilities include markerless vision-based localization, autonomous docking and charging, perching on handrails to conserve energy, and carrying modular payloads. Its open-source flight software runs on three interconnected smart phone class processors and uses the Robot Operating System. We present an architectural overview of the software and discusses lessons learned from its development. We highlight several projects already using Astrobee Robot Software to develop and test novel research ideas.},

abstract = {Astronaut time will always be in short supply, consumables (e.g., oxygen) will always be limited, and some work will not be feasible, or productive, for astronauts to do manually. Free flying robots offer significant potential to perform a great variety of tasks, include routine, repetitive, or simple but long-duration work, such as conducting environment surveys, taking sensor readings, or monitoring crew activities. The " Astrobee " project is developing a new assistive free-flying robot system suitable for performing Intravehicular Activity (IVA) work on the Internation Space Station (ISS). This paper describes the Astrobee project objectives, initial design, concept of operations, and key challenges.},

Astrobee will accommodate a variety of payloads and enable guest scientists to run experiments in zero-g, as well as assist astronauts and ground controllers. Astrobee will replace the SPHERES robots which currently operate on the ISS, whose use of fixed ultrasonic beacons for localization limits them to work in a 2 meter cube. Astrobee localizes with monocular vision and an IMU, without any environmental modifications. Visual features detected on a pre-built map, optical flow information, and IMU readings are all integrated into an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the robot pose. We introduce several modifications to the filter to make it more robust to noise, and extensively evaluate the localization algorithm.},

abstract = {We present a handrail detection and pose estimation algorithm for the free-flying Astrobee robots that will operate inside the International Space Station. The Astrobee will be equipped with a single time-of-flight depth sensor and a compliant perching arm to grab the International Space Station handrails. Autonomous perching enables a free-flying robot to minimize power consumption by holding its position without using propulsion. Astrobee is a small robot with many competing demands on its computing, power, and volume resources. Therefore, for perching, we were limited to using a single compact sensor and a lightweight detection algorithm. Moreover, the handrails on the International Space Station are surrounded by various instruments and cables, and the lighting conditions change significantly depending on the light sources, time, and robot location. The proposed algorithm uses a time-of-flight depth sensor for handrail perception under varying lighting conditions and utilizes the geometric characteristics of the handrails for robust detection and pose estimation. We demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the algorithm in various environment scenarios.},

abstract = {We present an illumination-robust visual localization algorithm for Astrobee, a free-flying robot designed to autonomously navigate on the International Space Station (ISS). Astrobee localizes with a monocular camera and a pre-built sparse map composed of natural visual features. Astrobee must perform tasks not only during the day, but also at night when the ISS lights are dimmed. However, the localization performance degrades when the observed lighting conditions differ from the conditions when the sparse map was built. We investigate and quantify the effect of lighting variations on visual feature-based localization systems, and discover that maps built in darker conditions can also be effective in bright conditions, but the reverse is not true. We extend Astrobee's localization algorithm to make it more robust to changing-light environments on the ISS by automatically recognizing the current illumination level, and selecting an appropriate map and camera exposure time. We extensively evaluate the proposed algorithm through experiments on Astrobee.},
