# a-brief-guide-to-astrobee

This is the latest available version of "A Brief Guide to Astrobee's Flight Software," a guide to modifying Astrobee's Flight Software source code to incorporate GNC and autonomy modifications. The Astrobee Flight Software (AFS) is written by NASA Ames and is available [here](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee); this document was originally produced by members of the MIT Space Systems Lab and the Ventura group at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico to complement the AFS documentation.

## LaTeX

`tex` contains the LaTeX for creating this document. `main.tex` is the sole TeX file for the guide. All images are in `img`, and many are generated from `astrobee_guide_palette.svg`.

Note that the markdown package is used (so that markdown
can be used within LaTeX), see [here](http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/CTAN/macros/generic/markdown/markdown.html).
